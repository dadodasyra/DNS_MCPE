# DNS_MCPE
 The plugin for the DNS 185.142.53.40, forms to redirect to custom servers

# Plugin use
 To use the plugin, nothing could be simpler, add it in `plugins`, start the server once. Go to the config, change the mysql users and password to yours. Start the server again, and voila, if you wan't you can change the default

# Use DNS
 For more simplicity you can use the DNS already setup, put 185.142.53.40 in main dns and 8.8.8.8 in secondary dns. You can keep its dns it is no problem the rest will still work. Connect to a featured server and you will have access to our redirect server. Tutorials for changing DNS will soon be in place.
 
# Disclaimer
 Yes I'm the developer of Histeria but this project don't have specific relationship with my server. You can totally use the DNS and remove the Histeria default server.
